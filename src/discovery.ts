/**
 * What a `_x402` TXT record IS, when it isn't ours.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A census of the Bazaar catalog on 2026-08-22 found five
 * hosts publishing a TXT record at `_x402` under a grammar that is not this
 * one, in three mutually incompatible syntaxes:
 *
 *   v=x4021;descriptor=api;url=https://api.telemost.io/.well-known/x402
 *   v=x4021;url=https://tablint.dev/.well-known/x402
 *   x402-manifest=https://vibesprings.net/.well-known/x402.json
 *   https://api.auor.io/.well-known/x402                    (bare URL, no key)
 *
 * Every one of them points at its own domain, so this is not an attack — it is
 * independent convergence on the same design. Two of them differ from a
 * conformant record by exactly two tokens.
 *
 * `parseX402TxtRecord` returns null for all of them, which is correct as a GATE
 * and useless as a DIAGNOSIS: a resolver that silently skips a near-miss makes
 * the publisher invisible and tells nobody they were one character away. The
 * fragmentation risk to `_x402` is not that someone attacks the name, it is
 * that several people spell it differently and no implementation ever says so.
 *
 * So: strict enforcement, generous diagnostics — the same doctrine
 * `diagnoseManifest` applies one layer up. THE GATE IS UNCHANGED.

// URL should ask for. A census of 1,609 hosts on 2026-08-22 asked
// `_x402.<exact-host>` and recorded the draft's own author as a non-publisher:
// our record is at the apex `flareclaw.app` with `wk=` pointing at the
// subdomain `api.flareclaw.app`. Publishing at the apex is the natural choice
// for an operator with one DNS zone and several service hosts, and the naive
// reading makes them invisible.
//
// So a consumer must be allowed to walk up. That immediately creates a worse
// problem: on shared hosting (`*.workers.dev`, `*.up.railway.app`) the ancestor
// belongs to the PLATFORM, not the tenant, and one record there would make
// every tenant beneath it discoverable — including tenants who never published
// anything, and including hosts that do not exist. Our own control demonstrates
// it: `zzq-...-9931.flareclaw.app` inherits our apex record.
//
// A public-suffix list would answer "is this ancestor an operator or a
// platform", and we deliberately do NOT use one: it is a mutable external
// dependency, it disagrees with reality on private suffixes, and being wrong
// silently converts into false adoption claims.
//
// THE RULE INSTEAD — the ancestor must NAME the host. An ancestor's manifest
// speaks for a descendant only if the manifest itself references that host, in
// `facilitator.baseUrl` or in `resources[]`. That is a positive statement by
// the party who controls the zone, it needs no external list, and it closes
// the shared-hosting hole exactly: `workers.dev` publishing a record does not
// make tenant X discoverable unless the record's manifest names tenant X.

// ──────────────────── Negative caching ────────────────────
//
// RFC 2308's lesson, learned by DNS the hard way: under stress the
// NEGATIVE answer is the majority answer. Discovery is designed to be
// crawled across many domains, and most domains do not speak x402 at
// all — so a resolver with no negative cache re-pays full DNS + TCP +
// TLS for every non-participant, forever, and hammers a host that is
// already down.
//
// But a negative cached too long is a self-inflicted outage: a domain
// that just published its record, or just recovered, must not stay
// invisible. So the TTL depends on WHY, because the remedies differ:
//
//   no-record   — the domain simply doesn't advertise x402. The steady
//                 state for most of the internet; safe to remember for
//                 a while, and adoption is not a same-minute event.
//   unreachable — network failure, timeout, 5xx. Almost always
//                 transient, so this gets the SHORTEST TTL; punishing a
//                 recovering host for half an hour is our bug, not its.
//   invalid     — the document was served and is wrong (malformed, or
//                 violates a security rule). An operator must deploy to
//                 fix it, so re-fetching it every few seconds helps
//                 nobody — but it is not permanent either.
//
// We deliberately do NOT cache successes. "Was discoverable" and "is
// operating that way now" are different questions (the same doctrine
// the attestations spec enforces): the live cross-check exists to be
// live. We cache the absence of a service, never its presence.
